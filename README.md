What noobs write to prove they're worthless 

As of 19 November 2018, I have decided to make another GitHub account under my actual name to (eventually) prove that I am not a scrub with no Linux/coding/DevOps passion or talent. Enough of Linux as a hobby; I want to escape the cold dungeon of a Windows career and incarnate into the Lin-ox. Prepare to be whelmed.
